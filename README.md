# Azure AKS Solution Architecture
This repository contains a comprehensive solution architecture for deploying a containerized application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Bicep.

# Project Overview
This project is a demonstration of designing and implementing a modern, scalable, and secure application platform on Microsoft Azure. The architecture is built entirely with Bicep to ensure repeatability and consistency, following the principles of IaC.

The deployed enviornment includes:
- Virtual Network: A dedicated and isolated network for all resources.

- Azure Container Registry (ACR): A private registry for storing and managing Docker container images.

- Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): A managed Kubernetes cluster for orchestrating containerized workloads.

- GitOps (with Flux): The solution uses an AKS extension to enable automated application deployment directly from a Git repository, demonstrating a modern, declarative approach to Continuous Delivery.

# Bicep Deployment
The main.bicep file in this repository is a single, self-cotnained template that deploys the entire infrastructure. It demonstrates the ability to define a complete environment, from networking to application deployment, in one cohesive script.

# Prerequisites
- An Azure Subscription
- Azure CLI installed and configured
- Bicep CLI installed
- Permissions to create resources within a resource group

# Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository:
2. Log into Azure
    az login
3. Deploy the Bicep template
    az group create --name my-aks-resource-group --location eastus
    az deployment group create --resource-group my-aks-resource-group --template-file main.bicep

# Future Enhancements
This foundational architecture can be expanded with additional components to create a more robust production enviornment. Potential enhancements include:
- Azure Key Vault: To securely store secrets and credentials
- Azure Monitor & Container Insights: For advanced logging, metrics, and application performance monitoring.
- Azure Policy: To enforce security and compliance rules across the environment.
- Private Endpoints: To secure network access to services like ACR.
- Database Integration: Adding an Azure SQL Database or Azure Database for PostgreSQL to support a stateful application.
